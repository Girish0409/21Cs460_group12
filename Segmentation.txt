Our training data images contain Multiple unstained RBCs along with a stained WBC. In order to make the learning easy for the model, we wanted to send only the WBC portion of the image as a training data.
To do this, we used Image segmentation techniques. We tried to perform Cell segmentation first. We used the research paper from Manik et al {cite here} as a basis. However, we failed to remove the holes made by RBCs at the last step. So, instead we went with Nucleus Segmentation.
The method is shown in the figure below. First the RGB values of image is converted into HSV values where, H = Hue, S = Saturation and V = Value. Then we separate the saturation image and treat it as a separate grayscale image. The reason for this is because the stained nucleus has a considerabely higher saturation value as compared to other regions in the image.
Then using a threshold, we set all regions with high saturation as 1 and the rest as 0. This is called thresholding and three different algorithms gave us decent results. They were otsu, isodata and minimum thresholding. However, none of them worked perfectly for every image. So, we compared the results of each thresholding algorithm for random samples from the data and finally settled on otsu thresholding.
Now we have a binary image with white nucleus and black background. Then we multiplied its values with the original grayscale image to crop out the region containing the nucleus.
